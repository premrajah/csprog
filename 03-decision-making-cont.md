# Lesson 3: Decision Making (cont.)

The last lesson introduces to us decision making in flowcharts.
Base on what we've learned about program flows, this lesson will show us how to write code for it.

## 3.1 The if statement
C# (and most programming languages) supports programmatic decision making via some kind of `if` statement. Let's explore the C# `if` statement with an example!

The program: Asks the user for an integer number and display a message if the number is greater than 5.

```c#
int x;
string input;

input = Console.ReadLine();
x = int.Parse(input);

if (x > 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Greater than 5");
}

```

Let's dissect the code a little! 

* At this point, we should be familiar with the first four lines of code: declaring variables and reading user input.
* The next line is what an `if` statement looks like. It starts with an `if` (duh) and the condition is enclosed within a pair of parentheses. This is the **"Yes" branch** of the diamond shape (see 2.1.4).
* The body (or the action) of the `if` statement is between a pair of curly braces, `{` and `}`.

## 3.2 The body
In the previous example, the body if the `if` statement is enclosed inside a pair of curly braces. Something I didn't mention is that those curly braces are actually **optional if you have one action in the body**.

```c#
if (x > 5)
    Console.WriteLine("Greater than 5");
```

The example above works exactly the same. In fact, you don't even need to put the body on a new line! The next two examples are all equivalent:

```c#
if (x > 5) Console.WriteLine("Greater than 5");
```

```c#
if (x > 5) { Console.WriteLine("Greater than 5"); }
```

**So when do we need the curly braces?** When there's more than one statement in the body. This is the biggest got-cha to those not familiar with the if statements. Let's look at an example!

```c#
if (x > 5)
	Console.WriteLine("Greater than 5");
Console.WriteLine("This line will appear regardless of X");
```

As you can guess, the second `WriteLine` statement is executed even if `x` is less than `5`. Indentation does not matter either, since they are only for readability:

```c#
if (x > 5)
	Console.WriteLine("Greater than 5");
	Console.WriteLine("This line will appear even if x is greater than 5");
	Console.WriteLine("So will this line. Don't let the indentation fool you!");
``` 

This is when curly braces come handy:
```c#
if (x > 5)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Greater than 5");
	Console.WriteLine("This line will only appear if x is greater than 5");
}
```

For the rest of this course, I'll always enclose the body between curly braces to avoid confusion.

## 3.3 The else statement
So far we have only seen the `if` statement (or the *Yes* branch of the diamond). This section will introduce to us the `else` statement, the *No* branch of the diamond.

```c#
if (x > 5)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Greater than 5");
}
else
{
	Console.WriteLine("Less than or equal to 5");
}
```

## 3.4 Other examples

```c#
if (x > 5)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Greater than 5");
}
else
{
	if (x < 5)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Less than 5");
	}
	else
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Equals to 5");
	}
}
```

The example above can be written in a more condensed way by removing the curly braces of the first else branch:

```c#
if (x > 5)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Greater than 5");
}
else
	if (x < 5)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Less than 5");
	}
	else
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Equals to 5");
	}
```

Then remove the blank line:

```c#
if (x > 5)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Greater than 5");
}
else if (x < 5)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Less than 5");
}
else
{
	Console.WriteLine("Equals to 5");
}
```

## 3.5 The Switch statement

While `if` statements are powerful, sometimes things can get tedious when the program has to check one single variable for many different conditions. Consider the following example:

```c#
int weekDay;
// get user input

if (weekDay == 0)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Sunday");
}
else if (weekDay == 1)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Monday");
}
else if (weekDay == 2)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Tuesday");
}
else if (weekDay == 3)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Wednesday");
}
else if (weekDay == 4)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Thursday");
}
else if (weekDay == 5)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Friday");
}
else if (weekDay == 6)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Saturday");
}
else
{
	Console.WriteLine("Unknown");
}
```

Okay. So maybe we don't need to repeat Console.WriteLine every time:

```c#
int weekDay;
// get user input
string name;

if (weekDay == 0)
{
	name = "Sunday";
}
else if (weekDay == 1)
{
	name = "Monday";
}
else if (weekDay == 2)
{
	name = "Tuesday";
}
else if (weekDay == 3)
{
	name = "Wednesday";
}
else if (weekDay == 4)
{
	name = "Thursday";
}
else if (weekDay == 5)
{
	name = "Friday";
}
else if (weekDay == 6)
{
	name = "Saturday";
}
else
{
	name = "Unknown";
}

Console.WriteLine(name);

```

The example above is pretty straight forward, but as you can can see, it's a lot of repetitive code. This is when `switch` becomes useful:

```c#
int weekDay;
// get uesr input

string name;

switch (weekDay)
{
	case 0: 
		name = "Sunday";
		break;
	case 1: 
		name = "Monday";
		break;
	case 2: 
		name = "Tuesday";
		break;
	case 3: 
		name = "Wednesday";
		break;
	case 4: 
		name = "Thursday";
		break;
	case 5: 
		name = "Friday";
		break;
	case 6: 
		name = "Saturday";
		break;
	default:
		name = "Unknown";
		break;
}

Console.WriteLine(name);

```

When using the `switch` statement, there important things to keep in mind are:

1. The `case` keyword: as you can see in the example, `case` dictates the different values we're interested in.
2. The `break` keyword: this is usually something that beginners forget when using `switch` statements. The `break` keyword stops any further evaluations once a value matches.
3. The `default` keyword: as you can guess, `default` will be used when none of the specific values match. Notice that `default` is always at the end of the cases.


## 3.6 Boolean operators

Let's have a different example: the user will enter the month (0 to 11, inclusive). The program will print out how many days there are in that month.

First, let's use the good old `if` statement:

```c#
int month;
// get user input

month = month + 1; // increment one for human consumption

if (month == 1 || month == 3 || month == 5 || month == 7 || month == 8 || month == 10 || month == 12)
{
	Console.WriteLine("This month has 31 days");
}
else if (month == 2) 
{
	Console.WriteLine("This month has 28 or 29 days");
}
else 
{
	Console.WriteLine("This month has 30 days");
}

```

Something new that in this example is the `||` operator (two pipes). It stands for "or." The first if statement should read "if month equals to one, or three, ..., or twelve." Inside that whole expression, only one of the comparisons needs to be `true` to make the whole expression true.

Two other interesting boolean operators that you'll explore in the exercises are the `&&` "and" operator and the `!` "negate/not" operator. Keep this [truth table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table#Binary_operations) in mind as a reference:

![Truth Table](screenshots/03/truth-table.png)

The same example using `switch` statement:

```c#
int month;
// get user input

switch (month + 1)
{
	case 1:
	case 3:
	case 5:
	case 7:
	case 8:
	case 10:
	case 12:
		Console.WriteLine("This month has 31 days");
		break;
	case 2:
		Console.WriteLine("Ths month has 28 or 29 days");
		break;
	default:
		Console.WriteLine("This month has 30 days");
		break;
}

```

Notice that the switch statement is evaluating `month + 1`. It does not actually change the value of the variable `month` like the previous example. You can also see that the different cases are stacked together.


## 3.7 Exercises

1. Write the C# programs for the flowcharts from lesson 2 exericses.

2. Ask the user to enter a year and print a message indicating if that year is a leap year.

3. Ask the user to enter an amount of money in pennies (cents). Exchange the money for the user using the largest dolar bills possible. These bills and coins are available to you: 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1, quarters, dimes, nickles, pennies. Example: 

```
Please enter an amount of money in pennies: 24011
That amount can be represented using:

2 one-hundred-dolar bill(s)
2 twenty-dollar bill(s)
1 dime(s)
1 cent(s)
```
