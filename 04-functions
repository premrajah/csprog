# Lesson 4: Functions

## 4.1 Introduction
Computer programs often needs to perform the same tasks many times. Think about your previous exercise "Max of Three."
In that exercise, you ask the user to enter 3 numbers.
You probably had 3 lines of `Console.WriteLine`, 3 lines of `Console.ReadLine`, and 3 lines of `int.Parse`.
After gathering the input, we used an `if` statement to find the the larger number between X & Y,
then used another `if` statement to compare that larger number with Z.

As you can see, that was quite a simple program and we already have so much repetition.
Imagine something larger like an accounting program, it would be a disaster to have to write the same piece
of code over and over again to calculate the total revenue of each month within a fiscal year.
In addition, it's not a good idea to repeat the same or similar piece of code over and over again.
More code means more potential for typos, more mistakes, and more bugs.

This lesson will introduce us to *functions* (all so known as *methods*).
Think about it as a mechanism to **name** a block of code
and we can always execute that block of code by calling its names.


## 4.2 "Void" functions
You may not know this, but you have already seen a function. Let's revisit our "Hello world" program:

```c#
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello world!");
        }
    }
}
```

In this program, we have a single function called `Main`.
`Main` is a special function that C# recognizes as the entry point of the program.
Without it, C# won't know what to do when you click run.
Now that you have an idea what a C# function looks like, let's write our own!

Imagine that you're collaborating with a team of many people to write a program and you predict that the program will say hello to the user multiple times.
While everyone has an idea that we should say hello, you're seeing through out your program different variations of it:
"Hello world," "Hi there," "What's up," etc.
A simple solution is to have everyone call the same function `SayHello` whenever they want to greet the user.
Here's what the program would look like:

```c#
class Program
{
    static void SayHello()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello there!");
    }
    
    static void Main()
    {
        SayHello();
        SayHello(); // we're so excited that we are greeting the user twice!!
    }
}
```

It is pretty straight forward to declare a new function (for the purpose of this course, all function decorations start with `static`):
* The function signature starts with the `void` keyword, we'll learn more about this part of the function later in this lesson.
* The next part is the function name. In this case, our function is named "SayHello."
* The function signature ends with a pair of `parentheses`. We will also explore what these are for later in this lesson.
* After the function signature is a pair of curly braces `{ }` that encloses the body of the function.


## 4.3 Function naming conventions:
* C# (and .NET) convention uses "PascalCase" for function names, meaning that each word of the function name starts with an captialized letter.
* Function names must begin with a captialized alphabet letter. Any alpha-numeric characters are acceptable after that.
* It's recommended that function names start with a verb.

Example of some function names: 
* SayHello
* Sum
* Max
* MaxOf3
* IsLeapYear


## 4.4 Function parameters
So far we've written a pretty simple function. `SayHello` just does its own thing whenever it's called. What if we want a function that can take input from the outside world?

Consider our "Max of Three" program again: in this program, we prompt the user to enter integers 3 different times:

```c#
Console.Write("Please enter a value for X: ");
// ...
Console.Write("PLease enter a value forY: ");
// ...
Console.Write("Plaese enter a value for Z:");
```

If you're lazy and careless like me, you probably didn't type all 3 lines but copied them instead. And in the process of changing each line, I've made mistakes here and there. Wouldn't it be nice to have a function that can take in a variable name and print the same prompt for us everytime? Well, it's not that hard!

```c#
class Program
{
    static void PromptUser(string variableName)
    {
        variableName = variableName.Trim(); // ???
        Console.Write("Please enter a value for {0}: ", variableName);
    }
    
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        PromptUser("X");
        PromptUser(" Y ");
        PromptUser("Z");
    }
}
```

Let's disect our function decoration in this example!

* The function signature still starts with the keyword `void`
* In this example, we named our function "PromptUser."
* This time, instead of a pair of empty parentheses, we have `string variableName` inside them, looking very similar to declaring a variable. For this function, `variableName` is called a parameter. This parameter has the type of `string`.

This function signature tells C# that anyone who calls `PromptUser` must provide a string. Inside the function, this string will be known as `variableName`. If you tried to call this function without providing a variable name or provide the function with an integer, Visual Studio (the compiler) would error out.

> Notice that I have two extra white spaces around "Y." I'll let you figure out why I intentially do this and what `variableName.Trim()` does.

## 4.5 Parameter naming conventions:
Naming parameters is very similar to naming variables. Besides picking a meaningful name, here are the general rules of thumb:
* C# uses "camelCase" for parameter names, meaning that the first world is lower case. The other words in the name are captialized.
* Parameter names must begin with a lower case alphabet letter. Any alpha-numeric characters can follow.

Example of some pareter names:
* year
* x
* userName
* encryptedCreditCardNumber
* n1
* n2
